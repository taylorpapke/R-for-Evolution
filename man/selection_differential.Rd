\title{Standardized Selection Differential (S)}
\usage{
selection_differential(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_col,
  assume_standardized = TRUE,
  use_relative = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame.}

\item{fitness_col}{Character. Fitness column.}

\item{trait_col}{Character. Single trait column.}

\item{assume_standardized}{Logical; if FALSE, z-score inside.}

\item{use_relative}{Logical; if TRUE, compute relative fitness internally.}
}
\value{
Numeric selection differential S.
}
\description{
Computes \eqn{S = \mathrm{Cov}(w_{rel}, z)}.
If \code{assume_standardized = TRUE}, \eqn{z} is assumed mean 0, sd 1;
otherwise \eqn{z} is internally z-scored.
If \code{use_relative = TRUE}, fitness is divided by its mean.
