# Package Validation via Empirical Studies

This document confirms the reliability of the `lande` package by replicating results from three landmark evolutionary studies.

## 1. Geospiza fortis (Finch) Test
**Objective:** Detect disruptive selection.
**Result:** The package correctly identified 2009 as the unique year where disruptive selection (positive $\gamma$ for beak size) was statistically significant.

## 2. Lobelia siphilitica (Wildflower) Test
**Objective:** Detect stabilizing selection and directional trends.
**Result:** The analysis confirmed that early flowering provides a fitness advantage. It successfully detected stabilizing selection for plant height and water use efficiency, where intermediate phenotypes maximized survival.

## 3. Cyprinodon (Pupfish) Test
**Objective:** Identify primary survival predictors in high-dimensional space.
**Result:** The package identified nasal protrusion as the strongest predictor of survival and confirmed that extreme body size was a significant disadvantage.

# Visual Confirmation
The following surfaces were generated using the `univariate_surface()` and `correlation_surface()` functions to validate these findings.
